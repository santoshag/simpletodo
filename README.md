## Notes

Overall, had a really interesting time coding the app.

Challenges faced.
- Had quite a few difficulties working with layouts.
- activeandroid ORM does not have any online support. Issue - Date object is not deserialized correctly.
- backward compatibility of material themes to API 16 since material design was introduced in later API version (I think API 21) could not be done.
